description: "Six applied problems: queues, stocking, simulation, copier selection, legal decision tree, and assignment."
---

**Scope.** Applied OR toolkit across six real-world scenarios.

**Methods**
- **Queues:** Poisson arrivals / M/M/c → staffing to reduce balking.
- **Decision under uncertainty:** payoff & regret tables; sensitivity.
- **Monte Carlo:** profitability under cost uncertainty.
- **LP:** copier selection & cost minimization.
- **Decision tree:** expected monetary value (trial vs settlement).
- **BILP:** machinist→machine assignment.

**Tools.** Excel (Solver), LINGO.

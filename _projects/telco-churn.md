---

**Goal.** Predict churn and surface drivers to support targeted retention.

**Stack.** Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn), SHAP.

**Highlights**
- Cleaned & encoded mixed data; tuned a Random Forest baseline.
- Benchmarked vs Logistic Regression; evaluated with precision/recall & confusion matrix.
- **Explainability:** global & local insights with SHAP.

**Insights**
- Month-to-month contracts, short tenure, and higher monthly charges correlate with churn.
- Autopay/credit card customers churn less â†’ friction reduction matters.

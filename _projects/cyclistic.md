**Goal.** Understand differences between casual vs member usage for membership growth.

**Stack.** R (tidyverse, lubridate, ggplot2), Tableau.

**Highlights**
- Merged 12 months of trips; engineered `ride_length` and `day_of_week`.
- Built weekday/seasonality views (volume & duration) + dashboard.

**Insights**
- Members show weekday, short-duration commute patterns.
- Casuals spike on weekends with longer rides â†’ leisure-driven.

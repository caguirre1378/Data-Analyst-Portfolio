I work on data problems close to operations. The goal is simple: shorten the loop from “question” to “decision.” I ship small, reliable tools—spreadsheets, SQL models, and lightweight scripts—that people can use today.

**Current — Facility Support Manager, GBA Associates (DHHQ).**  
Own the facility-support workflow end to end (intake → triage → vendor dispatch → close out) and turn ticket data into decisions. Built:
- An Excel/VBA multi-criteria search across large project and work order lists (lookup time dropped from minutes to seconds).
- Power Query pipelines that consolidate multi-year exports and vendor files into one clean model.
- Compact dashboards for SLA and volume trends, aging, and recurring issues.

**Previously — Pro Sales, Lowe’s.**  
Managed contractor accounts, kept inventory and procurement moving, and shipped the simplest solution people would actually use.

**Education**  
- **B.S., Management Information Systems — George Mason University (2021–2023)**  
- **A.S., Business Administration — Northern Virginia Community College (2019–2021)**

## How I work
- **Start with a Decision Brief.** What decision, by whom, by when, with what success metric and constraints.
- **Baseline first, then improve.** Establish the current number, define “good enough,” and iterate toward it.
- **Data hygiene before charts.** Pin down source of truth, keys, grains, and definitions. Keep a short data dictionary.
- **Make it refreshable.** One click or one query to refresh (Power Query, SQL views, or parameterized extracts).
- **Short feedback loops.** Ship a rough cut early, demo, collect edge cases, and fold them back in weekly.
- **Explainability over cleverness.** Prefer simple, testable logic with checks and back tests.
- **Clean hand off.** A README, owner, refresh steps, and a rollback plan.

## What I can help with
- **KPIs and dashboards.** Translate goals into measurable metrics and build lightweight dashboards in **Excel / Power Query / SQL / Tableau**.
- **Data cleaning and modeling.** De-dupe, standardize, normalize dates, and build tidy **staging tables** or star-schema views.
- **Operational analytics.** SLA tracking, cohort and retention, churn risk, simple forecasting.
- **Automation of ad hoc work.** Refreshable pipelines; Excel + VBA utilities for bulk lookups and exports.
- **Decision support.** One-page memos with context, options, trade-offs, recommendation, and next steps.
- **Enablement.** Short docs and templates so the team can maintain and extend the work.

## Selected work
- **[Telco churn]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/telco-churn/):** model, drivers, and retention targets.  
- **[Cyclistic behavior]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/cyclist/):** weekday vs. weekend use; membership levers.  
- **[Layoffs data clean]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/world-layoffs/):** dedupe, standardize, type, and stage.

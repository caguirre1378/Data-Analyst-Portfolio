I work on data problems that sit close to operations. I build small, reliable tools that shorten feedback loops and help someone make a decision today.

Current: **Facility Support Manager, GBA Associates (DHHQ)** — own workflows, vendor coordination, ticketing/reporting, and quick fixes that remove friction. Built an Excel/VBA multi-criteria search for large project lists, Power Query jobs to consolidate history, and dashboards for SLA/volume trends.

Before that: **Pro Sales, Lowe’s** — owned contractor accounts, inventory/procurement, and the habit of shipping the thing people use.  
School: **B.S. in MIS (GMU)**.

## How I work
- Start with the decision, not the chart.  
- Keep the loop short: clean → check → ship → iterate.  
- Write assumptions down.  
- Prefer simple models that are explainable and easy to operate.

## What I can help with
- KPI design and lightweight ops dashboards (**Excel / Power Query / SQL**).  
- Data cleaning and standardization for analysts and reporting.  
- Practical models: churn risk, cohorts, queueing, resource allocation.  
- Brief decision memos with a clear recommendation.

## Selected work
- **[Telco churn](/projects/telco-churn/):** model, drivers, and retention targets.  
- **[Cyclistic behavior](/projects/cyclist/):** weekday vs. weekend use; membership levers.  
- **[Layoffs data clean](/projects/world-layoffs/):** dedupe, standardize, type, and stage.

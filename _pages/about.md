I work on data problems close to operations. The goal is simple: shorten the loop from “question” to “decision.” I ship small, reliable tools—spreadsheets, SQL models, and lightweight scripts—that people can use today.

**Current — Facility Support Manager, GBA Associates (DHHQ).**  
Own the facility-support workflow end-to-end (intake → triage → vendor dispatch → close-out) and turn ticket data into decisions. Built:
- An Excel/VBA multi-criteria search across large project/work-order lists (lookup time dropped from minutes to seconds).
- Power Query pipelines that consolidate multi-year exports and vendor files into one clean model.
- Compact dashboards for SLA/volume trends, aging, and recurring issues.

**Previously — Pro Sales, Lowe’s.**  
Managed contractor accounts, kept inventory/procurement moving, and shipped the simplest solution people would actually use.

**Education**  
- **B.S., Management Information Systems — George Mason University (2021–2023)**  
- **A.S., Business Administration — Northern Virginia Community College (2019–2021)**

## How I work
- **Start with a Decision Brief.** What decision, by whom, by when, with what success metric and constraints. No analysis without an owner and a deadline.
- **Baseline first, then improve.** Establish the current number, define “good enough,” and iterate toward it.
- **Data hygiene before charts.** Pin down source of truth, keys, time grains, and definitions. Write small, readable SQL/Power Query steps and keep a data dictionary.
- **Make it refreshable.** One-click/one-query refresh (Power Query, SQL views, or parameterized extracts). Version files and keep inputs in a `/data` folder.
- **Short feedback loops.** Ship a rough cut early, demo, collect edge cases, and fold them back in weekly.
- **Explainability > cleverness.** Prefer simple, testable logic. Log assumptions, add input checks, and back-test joins/aggregations.
- **Clean hand-off.** A README, owner, refresh steps, and a rollback plan. No heroics required to keep it running.

## What I can help with
- **KPIs & dashboards.** Turn goals into measurable, unambiguous metrics (clear numerator/denominator, time window, thresholds). Build lightweight dashboards with drill-through and alerts in **Excel / Power Query / SQL / Tableau**.
- **Data cleaning & modeling.** De-dupe, standardize categories, normalize dates, and build tidy **staging tables** or star-schema views that analysts can reuse.
- **Operational analytics.** Queueing/capacity & SLA tracking, cohort/retention analysis, churn risk, scenario tables for staffing or inventory, light forecasting.
- **Automation of ad-hoc work.** Convert manual reports into refreshable pipelines; Excel+VBA utilities for bulk lookups/exports; scheduled parameterized queries when allowed.
- **Decision support.** One-page memos with context, options, trade-offs, recommendation, and next steps—plus the numbers to defend it.
- **Enablement.** Short docs, templates, and quick trainings so the team can maintain and extend the work without me.


## Selected work
- **[Telco churn](/projects/telco-churn/):** model, drivers, and retention targets.  
- **[Cyclistic behavior](/projects/cyclist/):** weekday vs. weekend use; membership levers.  
- **[Layoffs data clean](/projects/world-layoffs/):** dedupe, standardize, type, and stage.

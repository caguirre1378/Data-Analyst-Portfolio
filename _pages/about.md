I work on data problems close to operations. The goal is simple: shorten the loop from “question” to “decision.” I ship small, reliable tools—spreadsheets, SQL models, and lightweight scripts—that people can use today.

**Current — Facility Support Manager, GBA Associates (DHHQ).**  
Own the facility-support workflow end-to-end (intake → triage → vendor dispatch → close-out) and turn ticket data into decisions. Built:
- An Excel/VBA multi-criteria search across large project/work-order lists (lookup time dropped from minutes to seconds).
- Power Query pipelines that consolidate multi-year exports and vendor files into one clean model.
- Compact dashboards for SLA/volume trends, aging, and recurring issues.

**Previously — Pro Sales, Lowe’s.**  
Managed contractor accounts, kept inventory/procurement moving, and shipped the simplest solution people would actually use.

**Education**  
- **B.S., Management Information Systems — George Mason University (2021–2023)**  
- **A.S., Business Administration — Northern Virginia Community College (2019–2021)**

## How I work
- Start with the decision, not the chart.  
- Keep the loop short: ingest → clean → check → **ship** → observe → iterate.  
- Write assumptions and constraints down.  
- Prefer simple, explainable models that are easy to operate and hand off.

## What I can help with
- KPI design and lightweight operational dashboards (**Excel / Power Query / SQL**).  
- Data cleaning & standardization; build tidy, reusable staging tables for analysts.  
- Practical models: churn risk, cohorts, queueing, resource allocation.  
- Concise decision memos with a clear recommendation and next steps.

## Selected work
- **[Telco churn](/projects/telco-churn/):** model, drivers, and retention targets.  
- **[Cyclistic behavior](/projects/cyclist/):** weekday vs. weekend use; membership levers.  
- **[Layoffs data clean](/projects/world-layoffs/):** dedupe, standardize, type, and stage.

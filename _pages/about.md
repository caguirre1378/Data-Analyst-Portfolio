## Why I do this
I like messy, operational problems where the answer isn’t obvious yet. The impact is real, the data is noisy, and the job is making decisions—with models that are simple enough to explain and clear enough to act on.

## Guiding principles
- **Decisions > dashboards.** If it doesn’t change a decision, it’s a chart, not insight.  
- **Small & direct.** Fewer features, consistent data, and docs that survive hand-offs.  
- **Document the unknowns.** Assumptions and data caveats are first-class citizens.  
- **Explainability matters.** I’d rather be ~90% accurate and 100% actionable.  
- **Ship > perfect.** Useful beats precious.  
- **People + pipelines.** Collaboration habits beat any single tool or framework.

## Now / Next
**Now**
- Hardening evaluation checklists (leakage, drift, fairness) I can reuse across projects.  
- Turning SHAP-style outputs into short, decision-ready stories.  
- Refining metrics that reflect “decision quality,” not just model accuracy.

**Next**
- Lightweight monitoring patterns for small ML/data services.  
- Better human-in-the-loop review for borderline predictions.  
- Writing more—short postmortems and playbooks beat tribal knowledge.

## Outside of work
I’m happiest when I’m learning something new, simplifying a process, or explaining a tricky topic clearly. Offline: long walks and rebuilding notebooks I *swear* I’ll keep tidy this time.

## Say hello
Open to data/ML roles and interesting collaborations.

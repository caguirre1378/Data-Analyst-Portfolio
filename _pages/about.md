I work on data problems that sit close to operations. I build small, reliable tools that shorten feedback loops and help someone make a decision today.

Current: **Facility Support Manager at DHHQ** (GBA Associates). I maintain workflows, vendors, and reporting; shipped an Excel/VBA multi-criteria search for large project lists, Power Query pipelines to clean history, and dashboards for SLA/volume trends.

Before that: **Pro Sales at Lowe’s**—owned contractor relationships and learned to ship the thing people will actually use.  
School: **B.S., MIS — George Mason University**.

## How I work
- Start with the decision, not the chart.
- Keep the loop short: clean → check → ship → iterate.
- Write the assumptions down.
- Favor simple models that are explainable and easy to operate.

## What I can help with
- KPI design and lightweight operational dashboards (Excel/Power Query/SQL).
- Data cleaning/standardization for analysts and reporting.
- Practical models: churn risk, cohorts, queueing, resource allocation.
- Concise decision memos with a clear recommendation.

## Selected work
- **[Telco churn](/projects/telco-churn/):** model + drivers and retention targets.
- **[Cyclistic behavior](/projects/cyclist/):** weekday vs. weekend use, membership levers.
- **[Layoffs data clean](/projects/world-layoffs/):** dedupe, standardize, type, and stage.
